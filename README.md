## Handling sensitive or temporary configs

The following files will be sourced automatically if they exist:

- `~/.emacs.local.el`
- `~/.vimrc.local.vim`

## Extra manual steps

This brings [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) as a
[LSP client](https://langserver.org) for Neovim. However, no LSP servers are
installed by default.

A comprehensive list of available LSP servers and CoC extensions can be found
[here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions#implemented-coc-extensions).

The `extras` folder will contain files that need to be handled manually.
